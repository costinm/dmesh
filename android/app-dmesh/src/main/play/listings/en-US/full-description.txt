Allow device to device communication in areas without internet access by using the P2P Wifi capabilities to create an expanding and automatic mesh.

The app will scan and create P2P groups by alternating the AP role. Communication between devices is encrypted end to end with mTLS. 

If an internet connection exists, the app can extend the reach and communicate with VPN servers.
