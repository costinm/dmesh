# L2 support 

In addition to 'standard' Wifi and mobile, Android devices can use additional data links:
- BLE 
- legacy Bluetooth - for older devices or higher speed
- NAN
- WifiDirect 
- local unrouted AP mode

In all cases the communication is not routed and may not use IP. 

The basic communication uses a 'handle' that hides the actual MAC and 
sends messges. Higher layer may add encryption and a public-key address.

## Streams

For WifiDirect/AP in addition to messages it is possible to establish connections
and streams, using local IPs. 

# API

The L2 library is controlled using messages, either from the android app or from 
the control plane or other nodes. 

Current API:

- bt disc - make device discoverable, will show a disalog
- bt - scan for nearby nodes, max 15 sec. Look for devices with name prefix "DM-" 
- /bt/discovery (name, addr) on discovery
- /bt/start (name, addr, satus) on startup if BT is found.
